### Endurance & Cardiovascular
- Moderate VO‚ÇÇmax response.
- Good mitochondrial adaptation.
- Requires combination of moderate cardio and HIIT for best outcomes.

### Inflammation & Heart Health

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise Recommendations (Best for You)

Based on your genetics and current fitness goals, you respond well to:

- **Strength Training:** 4 sessions per week focusing on compound movements (squats, lunges, presses, rows) to build and maintain muscle, support metabolism, and improve bone density.
- **Cardio:** Moderate-intensity cardio (cycling, swimming, brisk walking) 2‚Äì3 times/week to support cardiovascular health and fat loss.
- **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):** 1‚Äì2 times/week for improved VO‚ÇÇmax, endurance, and fat oxidation.
- **Active Walking:** Target 11,000‚Äì12,000 steps/day to improve calorie burn and metabolic health.
- **Mobility & Recovery:** Daily stretching or yoga/Tai Chi for joint flexibility, stress relief, and improved sleep.
- **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increasing weights or resistance over time for muscle adaptation.
- **Longer Recovery Periods:** Allowing extra rest between intense workouts due to slower lactate clearance.
